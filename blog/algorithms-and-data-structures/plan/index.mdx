This is a rough plan for a series of blog posts capturing my process of learning and brushing up on different data structures and algorithms.

I'll be covering all of them from the perspective of a FrontEnd developer. Including implementations in `JavaScript` as well as examples of how these **data structures and algorithms** are being used in **browsers** and **web development**.

> Disclamer: I'm learning myselfs, so if you see any silly mistake, hit me up and I'll most definitely fix it!
